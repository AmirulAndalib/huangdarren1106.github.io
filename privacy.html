      <p>Processing as per GDPR (The General Data Protection Regulation) as per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU)

    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="users-rights-and-data">Users&#39; rights and data</h2>
  <p>Regarding the processing of data, users have the right to:</p>

    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and have the same transmitted to other
        providers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</p>

  <h3 id="user-account">User Account</h3>

    services, namely:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Your Spotify Username</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Top 20 artists from your listening history.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Our Web Application does not request data from Spotify in the background if you are not actively using our web
    application.</p>
  <p>During the login process, we obtain your consent to be able to access the above data from Spotify. The data
    retrieved from your Spotify account will be exclusively used to provide you with our services.</p>

  <h3 id="google-analytics">Google Analytics</h3>
  <p>We use Google Analytics on our website. This web analytics service is provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon
    House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
  <p>For more information about how Google uses data when you use our Web Application, please refer to <a
      href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Through certification according to the EU-US Privacy Shield: <a

  </p>
  <p>Google Analytics guarantees it will follow the EU&#39;s data protection regulations when processing data in the
    United States.</p>
  <p>The Google Analytics service is used to analyse how our website is used. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para.1 lit. f)
    GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in our Web Application&#39;s analysis, optimisation and economic operation.</p>
  <p>Usage and user-related information, such as IP address, place, time, or frequency of your visits to our Web
    Application, will be transmitted to a Google server in the United States and stored there. However, we use Google
    Analytics with the so-called anonymisation function, whereby Google truncates the IP address within the EU or the
    EEA before it is transmitted to the US.</p>
  <p>Google Analytics uses the data collected in this way to provide us with an evaluation of visits to our Web
    Application and what visitors do once there.</p>
  <p>This data can also be used to provide other services related to the use of our website and of the internet in
    general.</p>
  <p>Google Analytics states that it will not connect your IP address to other data.</p>
  <p>In addition, Google Analytics provides further information with regard to its data protection practices at <a
      href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en</a>,
    including options you can exercise to prevent such use of your data.</p>
  <p>In addition, Google Analytics offers an opt-out add-on at <a
      href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en</a> in
    addition to further information.</p>
  <p>This add-on can be installed on the most popular web browsers and offers further control over the data that Google
    Analytics collects when you visit our Web Application.</p>
  <p>The add-on informs Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) that no information about the website visit should be
    transmitted to Google Analytics.</p>
  <p>However, this does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or other web analytics services we may use
    as detailed herein.</p>
