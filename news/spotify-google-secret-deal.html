<h1>Spotify's Secret Handshake with Google Skips Pesky Android Fees</h1>
  <img class="w-full rounded" src="/spotify-google-secret-deal.jpg" alt="Spotify's Secret Handshake with Google Skips Pesky Android Fees">


<p>Hey everyone, have you heard the latest buzz from the Epic v. Google courtroom drama? It&#39;s a real eye-opener! Spotify, our beloved music streaming service, seems to have played its cards right in a secret deal with Google. This isn&#39;t just any deal &ndash; it&#39;s like finding a hidden cheat code in the world of Android app fees.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s the scoop: Don Harrison, the big shot in charge of global partnerships at Google, spilled the beans under oath. He said that when it comes to paying commission, Spotify&#39;s pretty much playing on easy mode. If users buy subscriptions through Spotify&rsquo;s own system, guess how much commission they pay? A big, round zero percent! And if they go through Google? Just 4 percent, which is way less than the usual 15 percent Google asks from others.</p>

  <p>Now, you might be thinking, &quot;Why all the secrecy?&quot; Well, Google was trying to keep this under wraps during its scuffle with Epic over antitrust stuff. They were worried that if other app developers got wind of Spotify&rsquo;s sweet deal, they&rsquo;d all want a piece of that pie. Speaking of pies, have you tried out the <a href="/">Spotify Pie Chart tool</a>? It&#39;s this cool feature that shows you your musical tastes in a fun, visual pie chart format. Totally worth checking out!</p>

<p>Back to the story &ndash; Google&#39;s User Choice Billing program, kicked off in 2022, was supposed to give developers a break by cutting about 4 percent off the Play Store commission. But honestly, it&rsquo;s not much of a saving since developers have to cover their own payment processing fees.</p>

<p>But why did Spotify get such a killer deal? Harrison says it&rsquo;s because Spotify is super popular, and if it doesn&rsquo;t work smoothly on Android, people might think twice about buying Android phones. Plus, both Spotify and Google have put in $50 million each into a &ldquo;success fund.&rdquo; Talk about commitment!</p>

<p>Google&#39;s spokesperson, Dan Jackson, kinda acknowledged this whole thing when talking to The Verge. He said some developers who really dive deep into Android and Play might get different fee setups as part of larger partnerships that include big financial investments and product integrations. These deals help bring more users to Android and Play, making things better for everyone &ndash; users and developers alike.</p>

<p>Now, was Spotify the only one to get such a deal? Google&#39;s staying mum on that. But we did hear during the trial that Netflix got offered a special 10 percent rate, which they turned down. Netflix isn&rsquo;t paying Google anything now for app distribution since they ditched the in-app purchase option on Android.</p>

<p>Remember when Spotify was all grumpy about in-app purchase fees? Well, in mid-2023, they said &ldquo;bye-bye&rdquo; to Apple&rsquo;s App Store billing system to avoid paying up to a 30 percent commission. They&rsquo;ve been pretty vocal with their dislike for these fees, even joining forces with the Coalition for App Fairness, which includes Epic and supports their fight against Apple and Google.</p>

<p>But while Epic is still duking it out in court, Spotify seems to have found a smoother, wallet-friendly path with Google. It&rsquo;s like finding a secret tunnel in a maze &ndash; a little sneaky, but totally effective. Stay tuned for more juicy tech gossip! ðŸŽ§ðŸ’¸</p>
